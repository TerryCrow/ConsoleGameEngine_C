# Console Game Engine

This is a Game Engine for console, It's build by C language, And it just draw with ASCII.
Like this:
```
  O   	  O   	  O
<[&L==	<[&[==	<[&v==
 \]>  	 \]7 	_\]\
 | `  	 / `	    \
```

Well just for fun.
but there is some few problem:
1. I am a Chinese, I don't speak English. So communication will be a little bit complicated.
2. I only have a Windows device, I will buy a cheap pad and install ubuntu, so Linux verson will be relese latter.
3. Windows have some annoying feture that can't let color work on the engine.
4. I just learn C language, So any help will be good. please.

So that's it.
